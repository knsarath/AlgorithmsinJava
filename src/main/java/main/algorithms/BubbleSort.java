/**
 * Bubble Sort
 * Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
 * Example:
 * First Pass:
 * ( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.
 * ( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4
 * ( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2
 * ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.
 *
 * Second Pass:
 * ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 )
 * ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2
 * ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
 * ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
 * Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
 *
 * Third Pass:
 * ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
 * ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
 * ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
 * ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
